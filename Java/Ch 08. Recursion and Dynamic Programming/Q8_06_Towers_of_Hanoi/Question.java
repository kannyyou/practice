/**
 * Towers of Hanoi : In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi,
 * you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. 
 * The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom 
 * (i.e., each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You have the following constraints.
 *
 * 1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
 * 2. A disk is slid off the top of one tower another tower.
 * 3. A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
 * Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using stacks.
